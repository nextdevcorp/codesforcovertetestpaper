dont give serial number in question.just question text

remember there is no calculator, so keep it till that part a human can do without calculator

{one question has multiple part, keep the question as it is}

you can add mark distribution as in the image

if quesion/answer has image skip only the image , we will add it later

if the image contain different subject , give different json for each

dont do this **$S_N2$:** , do $S_N2$ or **S_N2:**
